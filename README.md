Aurelia is a new JavaScript client framework that focuses on standards-compliance. Do you need to start a new project or update an existing Angular 1 app? Then take a look at Aurelia with Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak. 

In this course, you'll learn about some of Aurelia's features. You'll see how easy it is to work with Aurelia with a test application and hopefully you will leave persuaded that it's worth giving a chance among so many options for JavaScript front-end frameworks.
